# gocrest

So I really liked some of the things https://github.com/Kurt-Midas/go-crest did, but I also sorta wanted to learn this stuff on my own and really find my own legs on this sort of project. So he deserves a lot of credit on inspiration, but I dont think he was writing go. Feels more like java or c. So thanks to him for all his leg work.
